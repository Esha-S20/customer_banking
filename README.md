# Project Title: Savings and CD Account Functions

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of two functions, `create_savings_account` and `create_cd_account`, that calculate and update account balances based on interest earned. Both functions utilize the `Account` class from the `Accounts.py` file to manage account data. Additionally, a `main` function is implemented to interact with the user, prompt for account details, and display the calculated balances and interest.
